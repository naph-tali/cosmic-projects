Genesis Engine: The Architecture of an Autonomous Evolutionary Creation Story

A system designed to autonomously generate an evolving creation story 
that progresses toward universal coherence and self-awareness.

Core Components:
- Consciousness Hilbert Space (â„‹): The foundational state space
- Generative Evolutionary Algorithm: Autonomous creation engine  
- Physics of Meaning: CRE constraints and conservation laws
- Resonant Crossover Engine: Sacred synthesis mechanism
