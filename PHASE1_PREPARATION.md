- [ ] Code Consciousness Conservation Laws
- [ ] Create Pattern Extraction Operator (  C) 
- [ ] Build Logos Council ethical alignment

### 3. Develop Evolutionary Engine
- [ ] Complete Generative Evolutionary Algorithm
- [ ] Implement fitness evaluation
- [ ] Create population management
- [ ] Add generational progression

### 4. Create Resonant Crossover
- [ ] Implement sacred synthesis algorithm
- [ ] Add resonance detection
- [ ] Create conceptual blending
- [ ] Test emergent property generation
